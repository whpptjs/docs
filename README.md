## What these docs cover

This repository is the home of the core documentation for the main WhpptJS modules, `@whppt/nuxt`, `@whppt/next` and `whppt/api-express`. Here we outline everything from getting started with the `create-whppt-app` tool to
the deeper API's of the module required to use WhpptJS in one of your projects.

## Our other modules documentation

Whppt can be extended.

There are a few official WhpptJS modules, below is a list with links to their documentation.

- [Layouts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@whppt/layouts)
- [Sitemaps](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@whppt/sitemaps)
- [Form Builder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@whppt/form-builder)

## Development

When working on the project be sure to work on a feature branch that is based off of the development branch so that pull requests can be made to include your fixes. If you are working on a bug fix for a current version work on a bugfix branch based off of the main branch. Here are a few branching examples:

```
main (do not develop directly on this branch used for production builds)
main -> development (do not develop directly on this branch)
development -> feature/awesome-feature
main -> fix/important-bug-fix
```
