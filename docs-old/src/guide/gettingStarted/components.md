# Components

This section of the documentation should not be confused with <RouterLink to="/guide/gettingStarted/plugins.html#components">plugin components</RouterLink>. The following outlines the build in
components available Whppt.

When you register `@whppt/nuxt` with a nuxt app, a series of components will be registered globally within your Vue 
app. These components are either a necessity, e.g. the [Editor App](/api/components/EditorApp), which is required to show any of the
editor menus/components. While others are included to get you up and running faster with editable content.

Below is a list of all the components available out of the box with Whppt. Click through to check out more about each
component.

- [Editor App](/api/components/EditorApp)
- [Content](/api/components/Content)

- [Plain Text](/api/components/PlainText)
